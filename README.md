# 🧠 Introduction to Software Development – Java Labs

Welcome to my personal repository for practice labs created as part of the **Amazon Junior Software Developer Professional Certificate**, specifically within the first course:  
📘 **"Introduction to Software Development"**

This repository is organized into folders, each representing a lab designed to strengthen foundational software development skills using **Java** and modern tools like IDEs and GitHub.

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives

Through this course, I'm developing the ability to:

- ✅ **Explain the advantages of using an IDE** for efficient development and debugging.
- ✅ **Understand the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** and its real-world application.
- ✅ **Write and execute Java programs** using:
  - Variables and data types  
  - Control structures (`if`, `switch`, loops)  
  - Methods and parameters  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts  
  - String manipulation  
  - Basic user input and output

## 🧪 Lab Structure

Each folder contains a self-contained Java program that addresses a specific concept or skill. The labs include:

| Lab Folder       | Focus Area                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `scheduleLab/`   | Menus, user input (`Scanner`), control flow |
| `week2Lab/`      | *Coming soon* – Variables, loops, OOP intro |
| `week3Lab/`      | *Coming soon* – String handling, conditions |

> Labs will expand progressively as I move through the course and gain more experience.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Java 17+**
- **Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Command line tools (Terminal)**
